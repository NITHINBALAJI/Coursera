**Introduction**

The city of Bengaluru, in Karnataka is called as the Silicon valley of India. This city is flooded with IT and Tech companies which boosts the GDP per capita of the city marking it's place at fifth position in India[1]. Therefore, the buying potential of individuals is growing rapidly in this city.

For individuals, visiting shopping malls are like a one-stop destination for satisfying all their needs such as grocery shopping, dine at restaurants, fashion outlets, play games and watch movies. Retailers and  Property developers are taking advantage of this trend to build more shopping malls to balance and meet the demand and supply.

As a result, there are many shopping malls in Bengaluru and many under construction. Yet, the demand of the consumers is not meet. Therefore, property developers are willing to construct more shopping malls in this city as this  gives them a constant income. So now the property developers are left with a simple question - "Where should we construct a mall?". The is an important business decision to be taken as the location of the property decides its success or a failure.
